About - 

	This project was to make a Python script to scrape data from a given URL and store the data in a CSV file. 

	It handles multiple pages, creates a books.csv file, handles errors, and has unit tests.

	The url that is scraped is http://books.toscrape.com/
	It is hardcoded in the main.py file.

	this works on a standard python installation, no need to run any install commands.

Prerequisites - 

	1. standard python install
	2. internet connection
	
Instructions to run - 

	1. Download the zip with all the files.
	2. Extract all files.
	3. Navigate to the folder with the extracted files in the command line.
	4. (optional) Run the tests 
		- py scrape_v2_test_short.py
		- py scrape_v2_test_long.py
		- They should both pass.
	5. Run main.py
		- py main.py
		- Should generate books.csv in the same directory with 1000 rows of information.
